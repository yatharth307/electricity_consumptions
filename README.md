# Electricity Demand Forecasting

## Introduction
This project aims to forecast the demand for electricity for the next 1-2 years using historical data of monthly electricity consumption. The forecast will help in managing electricity production and procurement efficiently.

## Business Context
As a leading electricity distribution company, accurate demand forecasting is crucial for managing production and vendor relationships. The available data spans from January 1973 to December 2019, providing insights into past consumption patterns.

## Available Data
- Date: Month & Year
- Electricity Consumption: Trillion Watts

## Business Objective
1. Forecast electricity demand for the next 1-2 years.
2. Calculate error metrics (RMSE, RMSPE, MAPE).
3. Compare various forecasting models, including Decomposition, ETS models, ARIMA/SARIMA models with different parameters.

## Expected Outputs
1. Detailed code with proper comments.
2. Model validation metrics/accuracy metrics.
3. Demand estimation for the next 1-2 years on a monthly basis.
4. Model selection and justification.
